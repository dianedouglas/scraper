Imagine the doe-eyed sweetness of The Sundays and Madder Rose crossed with the more womanly worldliness of Tori Amos.

He's one to start furiously on projects only to shelve them either out of frustration with the process or if another opportunity might come along. However, the strength of Odo is such that Way should delve back into that repository of mangled tapes and extract more material like this. His means of production often involves a beat-to-shit turntable, a similarly beat-to-shit sampler, vocal growlings, and a noise-freak collection of pedals, resulting in a black noise miasma orbiting around MB, Lasse Marhaug, and Locrian. Odo is a comparatively brighter affair of harmonically interwoven tones and field recordings, but Way's menacing noise lurks throughout. The first of three pieces layers a set of harmonium-sounding drones whose linear stasis is upended by an arching churn of growling, low-end feedback, snapping into the second track of watery field recordings and subterranean drippings sutured to a chorus of mid-range sinetones. The final track engages an uneasy set of feedback tones made even more unsettled by a distant blackened cloud of rumbling distortion slowly joined by a metallic clamor and spectral blasts of wintery black noise. Think the more psychedelic noise of Ramleh, the transitional recordings by Emaciator from noise-to-drone, and most everything that comes out on Utech. Just 20 minutes long, but the price is certainly right!

Such is the course laid out by the oft-performing / occasionally-recording East Bay noise technician A.C. Way on this mighty fine 3"" cd-r. This man has performed in numerous projects over the years, bringing his battered turntable, abused sampler, and array of distortion pedals to such projects as Maleficia, French Radio (with MX-80's Bruce Anderson, no less), Carrion, Riqis, and probably a few others that have slipped our mind. All of those aforementioned elements work their way into the crosshatched structure of this 20 minute composition. Whatever Way is sourcing for the initial blast of noise is downright terrifying. As much as we'd like to give credence to the thought it's a reverberant scream captured inside the half-mile Baker-Barry Tunnel found in the Marin Headlands, it's probably a fortuitous abrasion manipulated from Way's turntable. As encrusted distortion and corroded noises begin to dismantle these unsettling sounds, a glowing tone also emerges as something of a shimmering, gilded beacon, that's as beautiful as the noises that preceded it are not. When the sound of the bees flutters through that ephemeral drone, Way hints at another wash of sonic horror but resolves those sounds as a vibrating massage of ecological white noise. Really nice work, and limited to 50 copies.

Delving into the darker side of country music a la Cowboy Junkies and Trailer Bride with layers of sliding, spidery reverbed guitar and gritty organs. The melancholic female lead vocals bring to mind the subdued yet powerful delivery of Hope Sandoval or Carly Simon. They're backed by higher, more angelic vocals. Their decision to include a tripped out cover of Blondie's ""Heart Of Glass"" seems very strange and out of place. The over the top warbly wah-wah guitars and plodding rhythms totally distracts from the brooding, languid Waycross atmosphere they've so carefully crafted. Instead, it comes across as an alienating, druggy blues rock rendition. Seems like they should've made it either a hidden final track or preferably just reserved it for the live setting in which it's surely a crowd pleaser. That said, if you can program your cd player to skip track 9, you'll have a cohesive, pleasing listen.

Waylander are back yet again with another album of Irish folk metal, set to sharpen the listeners mental and metaphorical swords. Sometimes when we write these reviews it's hard to know what to say. It seems that there are metalheads who can vibe on flute and other folk instruments, and there are those that don't. Well, we believe that this record is one of those rare times a band can bridge the gap. While the harps and such blaze on, crunchy guitars and howling vocals keep things from ever getting too gimmicky. Basically, it stays heavy even with some unusual instrumentation, which can sometimes feel like it's softening the song. And with song titles like ""Taker of Heads,"" or ""To Dine In The Otherworld,"" these guys are on the path to pure metallic nirvana. Any true metalhead will easily find something to love about this record. Give it a listen, and we think you'll agree. Recommended!

If someone told you it was Stockhausen, you'd be really impressed. The vinyl is probably the MOST BEAUTIFUL we have ever seen, even nicer than Stereolab's ""Emperor..."" import, which, you may recall, was gold glitter encased in clear vinyl. This 12"" is composed of grey, blue, yellow, and purple concentric circles of varying widths, some perfectly centered and some off center. Truly a beautiful object.

But their third album is pretty great too, an excellent electronica release in its own right and warrants complementary comparisons to AQ fave Amon Tobin. ""Decentertainment"" is filled with deep ambient headphone brain tuning stuff, stoned / downer hip hop beats and soulful vocal snippets complete with vintage vinyl scratchiness. Then a quick tempo change switches gear into bouncy drum & bass breaks surrounded by interesting samples and dubbed out melodies.

An original, consistently interesting, unpredictable and inspired approach to ambient and drum'n'bass. New Yorkers Olive, Lloop and Once11 have made a recording to equal their last. Their approach in this record is identical to their last (they even brought Eyvind Kang back in), lacking only uniqueness. But if you liked the first, you will certainly like this one.

But, we just discovered that we could still get copies of their first, self-tltled album, on vinyl, so figured we'd do a little write-up. Basically, We All Together were responsible for some of the world's best ever Beatles/Paul McCartney worship, this side of Wings. In fact, they cover two post-Beatles McCartney tunes here, as well as a song by Beatles proteges Badfinger. But you'd think they'd written 'em, the way their originals are totally in the same style of dreamy pop balladry Peppered (ahem) with psychedelic studio effects. All ten tracks here on their 1972 debut are replete with sad piano melodies, sweet backing vocal harmonies, and oh yeah they bust out some fuzz guitar too on the likes of ""Hey Revolution"".Brilliant, affecting stuff, given some extra charm by virtue of being from Peru and not England or the USA. Super recommended, something we'll always love, up there with any Beatles-y thing from anyplace (Emitt Rhodes, Aerovons, Rainbow Ffolly, what have you). It you haven't heard 'em before, you're in for a treat.
